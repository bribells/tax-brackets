First, thank you for taking the time to stop by and take an interest in the tax-brackets repository. If you haven't already, please take a look at the [Code of Conduct](../master/CONDUCT.md).


Additions are always welcome. However, for sensitive information that may be relied on beyond the scope of this repository, please include the source information with your contributions. If, for example, you find additional tax brackets and rates for the year 1908, we ask that you please include a link or image and description of how the information was discoverd. Primary sources are preferred, however reputable secondary sources will be considered. All Additions or changes to existing brackets must be approved before being added to the master branch.


If you have additional questions, please raise an issue.
